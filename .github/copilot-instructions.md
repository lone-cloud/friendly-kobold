# Copilot Instructions for FriendlyKobold

### General Coding

- Follow existing TypeScript/React patterns in the codebase
- Maintain consistency with the established project structure
- Use proper TypeScript types (avoid `any` when possible)
- Follow the ESLint configuration (includes SonarJS and security rules)
- Never create tests, docs or github workflows
- Stop asking me to run the "dev" script to test changes
- Try to move helper functions from component code to their own separate files to help minimize clutter

### Scripting

- when debugging: try to run script commands that will work for both bash and fish shells
